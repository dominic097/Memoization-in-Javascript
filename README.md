# Memoization-in-Javascript
A small sample that shows what "Memoization" is all about, through javascript. 

MEMOIZATION ???!!???
 Well, it is a means of saving/caching the result of a function pertaining to an argument(s) -- wherein future, this helps in preventing the execution of the same function with same argument(s), rather fetched from the cache.

-- PROS:
   * Only function with unique arguments are executed fully. Repetitive ones are fetched from cache. High PERFORMANCE is the reward here.
   * Would help a lot if you ever use RECURSIVE function anywhere.
